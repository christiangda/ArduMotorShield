# ArduMotorShield 

(Arduino Motor Shield Library)
==============================
This library is a basic driver for Arduino Motor Shield R3 (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMotorShieldR3)

## Overview:
This library help you to use the Arduino Motor Shield R3 in your Arduino projects.
This motor shield library controls two DC motors with a L298 H-bridge that can drive up to 2 amps per channel.
see http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMotorShieldR3 for details.

## Features:
  * Set the motor at a desired speed: range 0 up to 255
  * Brake the motor
  * Stop the motor
  * Release the motor
  * Throttle the motor (Up and Down)
  * Support you to programming easy, using a lot of "Keyworks"

## Library Usage:
  * Download the source
  * Place the "ArduMotorShield Library" folder in your Arduino1.1+ "libraries" folder ( details: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
  * Open example sketch: "file-->Examples-->ArduMotorShield-->TestMotorA" ( or another you want )
  * Connect the Arduino Motor Shield R3 to your Arduino UNO ( remember connect Vcc and GND on the shield to an extra power supply )
  * Connect your Arduino UNO, compile & upload the code
  * The motor should be running as described in the examples

## Version History:
  * Version 0.1: The first functional Tested version
